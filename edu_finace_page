🧩 OPTION 2: No Separate Release Branch (PO reviews developer) 👨‍💻 (Good for small or fast teams)
🔹 How it works

Developers → commit to developer

QA → tests directly on developer

PO reviews developer

Only approved commits → cherry-picked to main

✅ Advantages
Point	Explanation
Simpler	Fewer branches, less management.
Fast turnaround	Quick testing and deployment.
Good for small teams	When QA and PO work closely together.
❌ Disadvantages
Point	Explanation
Higher risk	One wrong commit in developer can affect PO’s testing.
Less isolation	If new dev commits come during PO review, confusion can occur.
Not ideal for large teams	Gets messy when many features are in parallel.
💡 Final Recommendation
Team Type	Best Option	Why
Small team (1–5 devs)	❗ No release branch	Simple, faster feedback.
Medium/Large team (5+ devs, QA, PO)	✅ Use release branch	Safer, cleaner, industry-standard.
🔁 My Advice to You (Aakash)

Since you’re practicing full DevOps workflow and planning to move into real company setups →
👉 Use a release branch for PO review.
It’s only one extra step, but it makes your project look professional and production-ready.

Would you like me to draw a final diagram comparing both workflows si
